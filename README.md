# Personal Website 2
### Link to website: https://bek000han.github.io/ 

This is my new personal website, which I've made specifically to showcase my experience, projects, education and so on.
I have made this in raw HTML and CSS, with a little bit of JS. The site is mobile responsive.

Later on, I am planning on refactoring the site to be more modular and extensible using ReactJs or VueJs.
